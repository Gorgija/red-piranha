|| <img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/mart/glaze/48/package-development-icon.png"/> ||What if you want to write your own business rules? This page shows you how. <br/> <br/> We assume that you've already checked out the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples] . And you've looked at the [EndUserGettingStarted User Getting Started] to see how you can put your own information into these examples. ||


_TODO Tidy this page_

== Introduction to the Rule Player ==

There are two ways of interacting with Red-Piranha to build and run your business rules
  * Red Piranha - the Web Interface for applying rules to your speadsheet. You saw this in the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples], and used it as part of the [EndUserGettingStarted User Getting Started]. These samples allow you to change the information in the spreadsheets, but not the rules that run in them.

  * Rule Player; If you want to build your own rules, you'll need the Rule Player. The Rule Player is downloaded from the web, but uses the power of your local machine. After it packages the rules, it uploads the finished package to the web, where we can share it with other users via Red Piranha.
<br/>

There is a third way if you're a [Dev-DeveloperGettingStarted developer, as set out here], 


== How does it work ==

We're not going to actually run any rules using Ruleplayer (see [EndUserGettingStarted End User Getting Started for that]). What this page shows you how to do is how to write and prepare your rules so that other people can use them.

  * [#What_you'll_need What you'll need before you get started]
  * How to [#Writing_your_own_Rules Write your rules somewhere]
  * [#Getting_the_Rule_Player Getting the Rule Player]
  * [#Running_the_Rule_Player Start the Rule Player to check and package these rules]
  * (Optional)[#Deploying_to_Your_Own_Google_App_Engine Deploying to Your Own Google App Engine]
  * [#Sharing_and_the_Community How to share your rules online] so that you and other people can run them.



== What you'll need ==

|| Google Docs Account || The completed, packaged rules are loaded as a file into Google docs. Obviously you'll need to create a [http://docs.google.com Google account] if you don't already have one. ||

== Writing your own Rules ==
_TODO Complete Section_

 # Edit rules online - e.g. using Google Docs, or host them anywhere on the web (e.g. Google Sites, file on webserver _TODO instructions for these_
 # Make the rules publicly available (so Red-Piranha can find them)
 # _TODO Helps if links to red-piranha project_
 # _TODO Suggest copy existing template_

== Getting the Rule Player ==
_TODO Complete Section and update in line with new screenshots / configuration_

There are three options for running the Rule Player. More information on each is provided in the next sections.

  * *Local Download JNLP* Download the [http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/red-player/release/red-player.zip Player as a Zip file from here] , extract (using Winzip or similar tool) then double click on RulePlayerLocal.jnlp. or to start it [ More Instructions here].For more information see later on in this page 
[#Running_the_Rule_Player_Locally_From_a_Download_Running the Rule Player Locally From a Download]

  * *Local Download, Batch (.bat) or Shell (.sh) file* Same as the previous option, but click on RulePlayer.bat / RulePlayer.sh to start the Rule Player. The main difference is that is is 'one less thing to go wrong' (i.e. Java Webstart), but you lose the automatic install of Java that Webstart gives you. 

  * *Web Start from Google App Engine* - Start the RulePlayer http://red-piranha.appspot.com/rulerunner/RuleRunner.jnlp  directly from Red Piranha running on Google App Engine.For more information see [#Running_the_Rule_Player_Directly_from_Web_Start later on in this page]. 

Either of these methods, if successful, you should see a screen similar to the following;

 <a target="_blank" href="http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/screenshots/screenshot-rule-runner.png">
 <img alt="RulePlayer Console" src="http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/screenshots/screenshot-rule-runner.png"/>
 </a>

Using the defaults (as set in the properties file - next section), you should see the following text;

{{{
Compiling Rules...
Using file:http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/war/sampleresources/SpreadSheetServlet/log-then-modify-rules.drl
Compiling complete
}}}

=== Running the Rule Player Locally From a Download ===
_TODO Complete_ <BR/>


  * Cover both local JNLP, Local Shell
  * Url : http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/red-player/release/red-player.zip
  * Configuring via rulerunner.properties - find and open this file in your favourite editor

{{{
# Properties file for when the RulePlayer is unpackaged / run locally

# The Url (Web Address) of the Rule File we wish to package 
RuleFile=http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/war/sampleresources/SpreadSheetServlet/log-then-modify-rules.drl

# Where we store the packaged rule file locally before uploading
KbFileName=LocalRuleFile.kb

# Your Google UserName - you'll be asked for your password later when the RulePlayer runs
GoogleUser=SOME-GOOGLE-USER@GMAIL.COM

# Only set these if you are having difficulty connecting to the internet (e.g. in a corporate environment)
# Uncomment (remove # at start of line) first
# Ask your friendly IT staff the values that you should use
# ProxyHost=SomeCorporateProxy
# ProxyPort=80

}}}

  * Configure Proxy - edit the rulerunner.properties file to contain the Proxy Host and Proxy Port that you use to reach the Internet (check your web browser / Internext explorer settings as they are likely to use same values).
