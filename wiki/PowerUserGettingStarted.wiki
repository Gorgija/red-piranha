Information on how Power Users can get started.

|| <img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/mart/glaze/48/package-development-icon.png"/> || You've already checked out the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples] . And you've looked at the [EndUserGettingStarted] to see how you can put your own information into these examples. But what if you want to write your own business rules? This page shows you how.||

== Introduction to the Rule Player ==

There are two ways of interacting with Red-Piranha to the Red-Piranha Project
  * Red Piranha - the Web Interface for applying rules to your speadsheet. You saw this in the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples], and used it as part of the [EndUserGettingStarted]. These samples allow you to change the information in the spreadsheets, but not the rules that run in them.
  * Rule Player; If you want to build your own rules, you'll need the RulePlayer. The Rule Player is downloaded from the web, but uses the power of your local machine. After it packages the rules, it uploads the finished package to the web, where we can share it with other users via Red Piranha.

(Actually, there is a third way if you're a [DeveloperGettingStarted] developer, but we'll leave that more detailld explanation for later)


== Target User Experience ==

  # Refer to User, running existing rules
  # What if want to run your own
  # Edit rules online - e.g. using Google Docs
  # Running the RuleRunner - screenshot
  ## Webstart Local, Webstart Dev, Local JNLP, Local Shell
  ### Talk through background to each
  ### Make sure have Java installed
  ## Settings
  ### Online Page - auto generate JNLP
  ### Offline - setting rulerunner.properties
  ### Offline - setting proxy
  ## Download rules - entering password
  ## Compile
  ## Upload to Google Docs
  ## Option to Deploy to GAE
  ### See if user / otherwise deploy page
