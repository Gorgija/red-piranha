Information on how Power Users can get started.

|| <img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/mart/glaze/48/package-development-icon.png"/> || You've already checked out the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples] . And you've looked at the [EndUserGettingStarted] to see how you can put your own information into these examples. But what if you want to write your own business rules? This page shows you how.||

== Introduction to the Rule Player ==

There are two ways of interacting with Red-Piranha to the Red-Piranha Project
  * Red Piranha - the Web Interface for applying rules to your speadsheet. You saw this in the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples], and used it as part of the [EndUserGettingStarted]. These samples allow you to change the information in the spreadsheets, but not the rules that run in them.
  * Rule Player; If you want to build your own rules, you'll need the Rule Player. The Rule Player is downloaded from the web, but uses the power of your local machine. After it packages the rules, it uploads the finished package to the web, where we can share it with other users via Red Piranha.

(Actually, there is a third way if you're a [DeveloperGettingStarted] developer, but we'll leave that more detailled explanation for later)

_TODO - Table of Contents about the section below)

== How does it work ==
_TODO Complete Section_

We're not going to actually Run any rules using Ruleplayer (see [EndUserGettingStarted End User Getting Started for that]. What this page shows you how to do is; 

  # What you'll need before you get started
  # Write your rules somewhere
  # Getting the Rule Player
  # Start the Rule Player to check and package these rules
  # (Optional) Create a new space on Google App Engine to run Red-Piranha
  # Share your rules online so that you and other people can run them.
