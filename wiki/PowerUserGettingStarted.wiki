And you've looked at the [EndUserGettingStarted User Getting Started] to see how you can put your own information into these examples. But what if you want to write your own business rules? This page shows you how.||

== Introduction to the Rule Player ==

There are two ways of interacting with Red-Piranha to the Red-Piranha Project
  * Red Piranha - the Web Interface for applying rules to your speadsheet. You saw this in the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples], and used it as part of the [EndUserGettingStarted User Getting Started]. These samples allow you to change the information in the spreadsheets, but not the rules that run in them.
<br/>
  * Rule Player; If you want to build your own rules, you'll need the Rule Player. The Rule Player is downloaded from the web, but uses the power of your local machine. After it packages the rules, it uploads the finished package to the web, where we can share it with other users via Red Piranha.
<br/>
(There is a third way if you're a [DeveloperGettingStarted developer], but we'll leave that more detailed explanation for later)

_TODO - Table of Contents about the section below_

== How does it work ==
_TODO Complete Section_

We're not going to actually run any rules using Ruleplayer (see [EndUserGettingStarted End User Getting Started for that]). What this page shows you how to do is; 

  * [#What_you'll_need What you'll need before you get started]
  * [#Writing_your_own_Rules Write your rules somewhere]
  * [# Getting_the_Rule_Player Getting the Rule Player]
  * [#Running_the_Rule_Player] Start the Rule Player to check and package these rules
  * [#Deploying_to_Your_Own_Google_App_Engine (Optional)Deploying to Your Own Google App Engine]
  * Share your rules online so that you and other people can run them.



== What you'll need ==

|| Google Docs Account || The completed, packaged rules are loaded as a file into Google docs. Obviously you'll need to create a [http://docs.google.com Google account] if you don't already have one. ||

== Writing your own Rules ==
_TODO Complete Section_

 # Edit rules online - e.g. using Google Docs, or host them anywhere on the web (e.g. Google Sites, file on webserver _TODO instructions for these_
 # Make the rules publicly available (so Red-Piranha can find them)
 # _TODO Helps if links to red-piranha project_
 # _TODOSuggest copy existing template_

== Getting the Rule Player ==
_TODO Complete Section_

There are three options for running the Rule Player. More information on each is provided in the next sections.

  # *Local Download* Download the [http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/svn/red-player/release/red-player.zip Player as a Zip file from here] , extract (using Winzip or similar tool) then double click on RulePlayerLocal.jnlp or RulePlayer.bat / RulePlayer.sh to start it [ More Instructions here].<br/><br/> For more information see later on in this page 
[#Running_the_Rule_Player_Locally_From_a_Download_Running the Rule Player Locally From a Download]
  # *WebStart from AppEngine* - Start the RulePlayer http://red-piranha.appspot.com/rulerunner/RuleRunner.jnlp  directly from Red Piranha running on Google App Engine. Click on the following link   _Note that this may not currently work on your Machine_
<br/><br/> For more information see later on in this page 
[#Running_the_Rule_Player_Directly_from_Web_Start Running the Rule Player Directly from Web Start]

Either way, if successful, you should see a screen similar to the following;
