_TODO_ Tidy this page


You've already checked out the [RedPiranhaExamples Online Examples] . And you've looked at the  [EndUserGettingStarted] and [PowerUserGettingStarted] to see how to add your own information and new rules to these samples. 

But what if there is something that Red-Piranha doesn't yet do, a feature you want to add? This page shows you how to get started.

  * [http://internetducttape.com/2007/0/03/howto_google_code_hosting_subversion_tortoisesvn/ This post] is a good description of how to checkout the Google code. 
  * Browse the source at [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/checkout source].

There are two parts to the Red-Piranha Project
  * Red Piranha - the core project, deployable to Google App Engine (GAE) that takes excel spreadsheets and runs pre-compiled rules against them. While this is a command line and other interace, mostly this project runs on the web.
  * RulePlayer - A GUI used by Power Users (see [PowerUserGettingStarted] in order to compile the rules for running in GAE. This runs (via Java Webstart, or local Java) on the Users PC (Windows, Mac, Linux or other). This is needed as Google currently do not allow some of the Code Drools needs to compile. Once compiled, the rule package is loaded into Google App Engine where normal users to can use tehm.

When checking out the two projects, they should end up in two paralel folders i.e.
  * 'parent_dir'/red-piranha
  * 'parent_dir'/rule-player

This is because the rule-player build depends on some items from the 'core' red-piranha project (e.g. Drools Libraries, the Core Red Piranha code) and puts the result (e.g. the Jar with JNLP files) in the 

_TODO_ Details on checking out both projects

  * red-applet project expects to paralell to red-piranha (i.e. both share same parent folder)
    * both for classpath and deploy  


== Building the code ==


_TODO_ blurb on the options Eclipse to test, Eclipse to build & deploy GAE, Ant build x2, Ant deploy GAE

=== How to run in Eclipse ===  

  * For the moment right click on the Red Piranha project name, resolve the build errors, let Eclipse carry out an automated build.
  * _work in progress_ an ant build file
  * RulePlayer Console
  * Red Piranha Junit Tests (see [ProjectLayout])
  * Red Piaranha Main methods (See [ProjectLayout]
    
   
=== Developer RulePlayer build ===
_TODO_  
  * Document both build file targets
  * Document Main Targets that you'll actually use (and what they do)
  * build.xml within the ruleplayer
  ** RulePlayer ant build will build jar, copy into red-piranha/war

  
  * repackaging of dependicings
  * security and signing jars using the jar-signer script 
 
 ** test in eclipse - right click and 'run as applet'
  
  
=== Developer signing RulePlayer jars ===

  * Explain Why - Webstart security (what is 
  * Jarsigner - file in rp/scripts
  * More info at http://java.sun.com/developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/sign/signing.html
  * Command similar to {{{jarsigner -keystore ~/.keystore *.jar mykey}}} but make sure that you are in
  red-piranha/war/ruleplayer/lib folder when you execute this.

== Deploying to App Engine ==

  * use the Google App Engine Toolbar in Eclipse
<img src="./images/google_app_engine_eclipse_button.png"/>
  * _work in progress_ an ant build file
  * _work in progress_ automated tools

== Building your own rules ==

This is for building your rules in the Dev environment. [PowerUserGettingStarted] details how most users will build the rules

  * _work in progress_  For the moment, you need to 
  # Write your rule (similar to [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/war/sampleresources/ExcelDataRules/log-then-modify-rules.drl log-then-modify-rule.drl]
  # Add you new rule using [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/drools/PreCompileRuleList.properties PreCompileRuleList.properties]
  # Create the pre-built KnowledgePackage using [PreCompileRuleBuilder.java http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/drools/PreCompileRuleBuilder.java] . TestPreCompileRuleBuilder is one easy way of running this through eclipse
  # Modify the [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/war/service.jsp Service.jsp] to include the option of selecting your newly created knowledgebase.
  # Deploy to Google App Engine and enjoy!

== Extending Red Piranha ==

_work in progress_ for the moment you'll have to explore the code!

*[http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/drools/PreCompileRuleBuilder.java Link to Builder]* The code that builds the pre-compiled rule packages. Start with the main[] method.

*[http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/ui/Rp2Servlet.java Link to Servlet]* The code that calls the pre-compiled rule packages. Start with the service() method that runs in response to the form submitted by the jsp submission.



== Red Piranha for Drools Developers ==

  * Red Piranha uses [http://www.jboss.org/drools] as a key library. It's focus is more on Excel and Google Docs users looking to add the power of a rule engine to their documents.
  * Google App Engine (GAE) is a key deployment target, and enforces key limitations on the code; For examples rules cannot be 'compiled' in the normal Drools way, hence the offline package step, before you deploy.
  * With Drools, you normally supply (1) The rules file (2) A Model (or data structure) holding the information that the rules act on (3) Java code to tie it all together. 
  * With Red-Piranha all you need is 1) the rules file. The Data structure is always excel, and there is standard Java code to combine the Rules and the excel spreadsheet. This makes it easier, although Drools gives you more flexibility (with a bit more work!).
