== Setup the environment ==
  # Ensure you have Java installed on your Machine
  # If you don't already have a google account, get one at [https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?continue=http://code.google.com/hosting/faq.html here]
  # Download and install [http://www.eclipse.org/home/categories/index.php?category=enterprise Eclipse]
  # Get the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subversion Plugin for Eclipse]: 
  # Get the [http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/download.htmlGoogle App Engine Plugin for Eclipse] 
  # Get the [http://www.jboss.org/drools/downloads.html Drools Eclipse Plugin]



== Checking out the code ==

Background Information on Subversion (SVN) source control, hosted at Google code
  * Google FAQ on using Subversion; http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/SubversionFAQ
  * [http://internetducttape.com/2007/0/03/howto_google_code_hosting_subversion_tortoisesvn/ This post] is a good description of how to checkout the Google code. 
  * Browse the source at [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/checkout source]. 

If you're logged in with google,
[http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/checkout This page] will give you more detailled instructions on how to Checkout the code

_TODO_ Details on checking out both projects

  * red-applet project expects to paralell to red-piranha (i.e. both share same parent folder)
    * both for classpath and deploy  


== Building the code ==

  * For the moment right click on the Red Piranha project name, resolve the build errors, let Eclipse carry out an automated build.
  * _work in progress_ an ant build file
  
   
=== Developer RulePlayer build ===
_TODO_  
  * Document both build file targets
  * Document Main Targets that you'll actually use (and what they do)
  * build.xml within the ruleplayer
  ** RulePlayer ant build will build jar, copy into red-piranha/war

  
  * repackaging of dependicings
  * security and signing jars using the jar-signer script 
 
 ** test in eclipse - right click and 'run as applet'
  
  
  
=== Developer signing RulePlayer jars ===

  * Explain Why - Webstart security (what is 
  * Jarsigner - file in rp/scripts
  * More info at http://java.sun.com/developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/sign/signing.html
  * Command similar to {{{jarsigner -keystore ~/.keystore *.jar mykey}}} but make sure that you are in
  red-piranha/war/ruleplayer/lib folder when you execute this.

== Deploying to App Engine ==

  * use the Google App Engine Toolbar in Eclipse
<img src="./images/google_app_engine_eclipse_button.png"/>
  * _work in progress_ an ant build file
  * _work in progress_ automated tools

== Building your own rules ==

This is for building your rules in the Dev environment. [PowerUserGettingStarted] details how most users will build the rules

  * _work in progress_  For the moment, you need to 
  # Write your rule (similar to [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/war/sampleresources/ExcelDataRules/log-then-modify-rules.drl log-then-modify-rule.drl]
  # Add you new rule using [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/drools/PreCompileRuleList.properties PreCompileRuleList.properties]
  # Create the pre-built KnowledgePackage using [PreCompileRuleBuilder.java http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/drools/PreCompileRuleBuilder.java] . TestPreCompileRuleBuilder is one easy way of running this through eclipse
  # Modify the [http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/war/service.jsp Service.jsp] to include the option of selecting your newly created knowledgebase.
  # Deploy to Google App Engine and enjoy!

== Extending Red Piranha ==

_work in progress_ for the moment you'll have to explore the code!

*[http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/drools/PreCompileRuleBuilder.java Link to Builder]* The code that builds the pre-compiled rule packages. Start with the main[] method.

*[http://code.google.com/p/red-piranha/source/browse/trunk/src/net/firstpartners/ui/Rp2Servlet.java Link to Servlet]* The code that calls the pre-compiled rule packages. Start with the service() method that runs in response to the form submitted by the jsp submission.



== Red Piranha for Drools Developers ==

  * Red Piranha uses [http://www.jboss.org/drools] as a key library. It's focus is more on Excel and Google Docs users looking to add the power of a rule engine to their documents.
  * Google App Engine (GAE) is a key deployment target, and enforces key limitations on the code; For examples rules cannot be 'compiled' in the normal Drools way, hence the offline package step, before you deploy.
  * With Drools, you normally supply (1) The rules file (2) A Model (or data structure) holding the information that the rules act on (3) Java code to tie it all together. 
  * With Red-Piranha all you need is 1) the rules file. The Data structure is always excel, and there is standard Java code to combine the Rules and the excel spreadsheet. This makes it easier, although Drools gives you more flexibility (with a bit more work!).
