== Project Layout ==
  * Update wiki [ProjectLayout] with new structure
  * add script folder
  
== Developer Notes ==

  * test in eclipse - right click and 'run as applet'
  * ant build will build jar, copy into red-piranha/war
  * more info at http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~amr/121/labs/eclipsetute/applet.html

  * Note on Junit Libs (from http://www.junit.org) 
  * Note on Servlet.jar from (from Tomcat) 

  * note about dependencies; RedPlayer depends on 
  ** (Todo put both of these into sub projects?_
  * Checkout trunk, checkout red-player




 
== Developer RulePlayer build ==  
  * Document both build file targets
  * Document Main Targets that you'll actually use (and what they do)
  * red-applet project expects to paralell to red-piranha (i.e. both share same parent folder)
    * both for classpath and deploy  
  * build.xml within the ruleplayer
  * repackaging of dependicings
  * security and signing jars using the jar-signer script 



Removal of signing (manifest
re jar all in one
Resign using jar signer)
_ todo - update build with this solution_
note about jre version used   

== Developer signing ruleplayer jars ==

# Run this command to sign the jar with your own key
# http://java.sun.com/developer/Books/javaprogramming/JAR/sign/signing.html
#
# Make sure you are in the war/ruleplayer/lib folder
jarsigner -keystore ~/.keystore *.jar mykey
