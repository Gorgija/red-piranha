Where is the FIT example?

Due to licence restrictions (FIT is available only under the GPL), it cannot be included
in the project (as Red Piranha uses the less restrictive LGPL Licence).

The original Book sample is still available at http://red-piranha.googlecode.com/files/droolsbook-chap6-sample_01.zip
